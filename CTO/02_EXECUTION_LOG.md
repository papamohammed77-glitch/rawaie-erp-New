# RAWAEA ERP — CENTRAL CTO EXECUTION LOG

## Purpose
Mandatory chronological record of tasks, evidence, decisions, tests, gates, and unresolved conflicts.

## Control rule
No task is considered complete unless its evidence, decision, implementation status, test status, rollback status, and gate are recorded here or in a linked durable task report.

---

## CTO WORKING METHOD — CURRENT OPERATING STANDARD

### Execution rhythm
**One Stage = one coherent execution unit → one comprehensive verification → one decision → next Stage.**

Do not subdivide a Stage into artificial sub-stages merely to make an already-small task look smaller. Break a Stage only when real safety, evidence, concurrency, or dependency isolation requires it.

### Working principles
- No guessing.
- No repeating evidence already proven and still valid.
- Query the full evidence needed for the stage in one comprehensive pass whenever practical.
- Execute the stage as one coherent operation wherever safe.
- Verify the complete stage result in one comprehensive pass.
- Once proven, close the Stage and move forward immediately.
- Do not reopen closed work unless newer authoritative evidence contradicts it.
- Do not turn simple work into a documentation or analysis loop.
- Decompose only genuine complexity; never decompose for its own sake.
- Optimize for measurable progress toward implementation, validation, and release.

### Constitutional principles carried forward
1. Do not diagnose critical findings in isolation; reconcile architecture, security, authorization, source-of-truth, workflow, Production schema evidence, equivalent functions/apps, and historical warnings.
2. Broad RLS is an observed fact, not proof of a defect by itself.
3. Authentication is not authorization; business-operation authorization and database integrity are separate controls.
4. Target-required business operations must be atomic.
5. One business fact must have one authoritative source of truth and one authoritative movement history.
6. Inventory mutations converge on one central controlled business engine; adapters are not competing business engines.
7. Applications are operational event sources, not autonomous business systems or databases.
8. Preserve the current V1 one-company/multi-branch architecture unless an explicit Target decision changes it.
9. Repair the smallest coherent boundary; do not reopen unrelated domains.
10. No critical code change before Target reconciliation against Original, Current, schema evidence, equivalent functions, and Architecture.
11. Evidence classification remains explicit: PROVEN / STATIC ONLY / KNOWN-REVIEW / UNKNOWN / TARGET DECISION REQUIRED.
12. Documentation must support decisions and safe execution, never replace measurable progress.
13. Production Schema + Persisted Evidence + Actual Deployed Definitions outrank assumptions, names, migrations, and historical code.
14. Important Production read-only evidence is persisted so the same diagnostic is not repeatedly requested.
15. Lifecycle responsibility is explicit: state, physical stock, history, audit, and administrative closure must not be duplicated across stages.
16. Treat the validation database as production infrastructure; use controlled test data and avoid unnecessary contamination.
17. Protect the business first, simplify operational work second, and never achieve one by sacrificing the other.

## TASK-004 — Production RPC Contract / Manual Voucher Send Path

**Status: COMPLETE — GO TO TASK-005**

### Confirmed evidence captured
- `create_manual_stock_voucher_atomic(uuid,text,text,text,uuid,text,uuid,text,text,jsonb)` is `SECURITY DEFINER` and creates a `Draft` Manual Voucher.
- `complete_manual_stock_voucher_atomic(uuid,text,text)` is `SECURITY DEFINER` and transitions `Sent` → `Completed` for `DirectSale`/`SupplierReturn`, and `Received` → `Completed` for `Transfer`/`DirectReturn`.
- COMPLETE writes `completed_by` and `completed_at`.
- Production inventory RPC evidence includes both `send_stock_voucher_atomic(uuid,text,text)` and `post_manual_stock_voucher_atomic(uuid,text,text,text,jsonb)` with `SEND` / `RECEIVE` operations.
- The earlier transactional fixture `IN-1` (`4062e2c6-f683-4a9c-bdc9-89705dbc7a7e`) was confirmed absent after its transaction ended.
- A persistent fixture was created outside `BEGIN/ROLLBACK`:
  - company `da4ef704-88ac-4120-aa0e-65b92b2aa2bc`
  - source `BR-01` / `151e5cd7-ac4a-4fc3-b703-d73a0dbb0dc6`
  - target `BR-2` / `a08568e5-40a7-4b15-85b4-ced8ebf9971d`
  - item `1004` / `ef864b14-ec62-4b9f-9932-17da041b6e42`
  - quantity `1`
  - voucher `IN-1`
  - voucher id `a0974ec8-a5d0-4339-a5fb-7d2d0cee1d64`
  - reference `TEST-004-PERSISTENT`
  - notes `TEST-004 PERSISTENT FIXTURE`

### TEST-004 results

#### STAGE 1 — CREATE
**PASS**
- RPC returned `success=true`.
- Voucher `IN-1` was created and persisted in `Draft` state.

#### STAGE 2 — SEND
**PASS**
- `IN-1` transitioned `Draft → Sent`.
- `sent_date` populated.
- BR-01 / item 1004: `qty 206 → 205`.
- `allocated_qty` remained `0`.
- `available_qty` became `205`.
- Exactly one `inventory_log` row was produced: `DirectSale`, quantity `1`, user `test-operator@rawaea.local`.

#### STAGE 3 — COMPLETE
**PASS**
- COMPLETE moved the voucher to the required completed state for `DirectSale`.
- `completed_at` and `completed_by` were populated.
- COMPLETE produced no additional inventory movement; the voucher retained exactly one inventory-log row.

#### STAGE 4 — FINAL VERIFICATION
**PASS**
- Voucher `IN-1`: `Completed`.
- `completed_by = test-operator@rawaea.local`.
- `completed_at = 2026-08-12 16:47:45.437064+00`.
- BR-01 / item 1004: `qty=205`, `allocated_qty=0`, `available_qty=205`.
- Detail: item `1004`, `qty=1`, `received_qty=0`.
- Inventory history: one `DirectSale` movement, quantity `1`.
- Final summary: `STAGE 4 PASS`.

### TASK-004 closure decision
**TEST-004 PASS. TASK-004 CLOSED / GO.**

The assigned controlled Production RPC contract test for the DirectSale `CREATE → SEND → COMPLETE` lifecycle is empirically proven with the persistent fixture. Alternate RPC consumers, Partial Receive idempotency, broader custody semantics, and other open architecture questions remain under their designated later Tasks and are not reopened here.

### Persistent fixture
Retained intentionally for subsequent controlled tests:
- voucher `IN-1`
- voucher_id `a0974ec8-a5d0-4339-a5fb-7d2d0cee1d64`

No automatic cleanup was performed.

### Production patch status
**None approved or applied by TASK-004.**
