# CURRENT FORENSIC CHECKPOINT — 2026-10-13 — Report418 Parent Orders Fresh Resync

## Current scope
Only the parent system's sales-orders table: `papamohammed77-glitch/erp-frontend/companies/company-1/main.html`, module `RW_Orders`. Owner applies parent UI changes. Assistant must not edit `main.html` or the operational app. Production/Supabase changes are assistant-owned only when fresh evidence proves a defect.

## Fresh current-source evidence — 2026-10-13
- Current parent source: `erp-frontend/companies/company-1/main.html`, blob SHA `92bec4b0b006c7a280ba48e0ab4279e44282687a`, 1,762,278 characters / 32,436 lines. This supersedes Report417's prior blob SHA `4f94f9c6ebdde1b59632384628c72767d3bb950d`; never reuse old line numbers.
- Report418: [Report418_PARENT_ORDERS_FRESH_RESYNC_AND_DIRECT_SALES_LABEL_20261013.md](doc/Draft/Reprots/Report418_PARENT_ORDERS_FRESH_RESYNC_AND_DIRECT_SALES_LABEL_20261013.md), commit `5a849f0f7edc0025f4583cf3aa89b2b8ad491556`.
- Report417 is historical evidence only. Its main A–H fixes are already present in the current parent source: 11-column table; source/creator/created-at columns; disabled checkboxes for ineligible sources; return-aware item counts; return-aware details/print; refresh of derived counts on confirmation and Realtime.
- Remaining exact owner patch only: in `RW_Orders._renderTable(data)`, current lines 10503–10509, add `'van-sales': 'بيع مباشر'` to the `sourceLabel` object. Full replacement is in Report418. Do not reapply the broader Report417 changes.
- Current source normalizes underscores to hyphens, so `online_store` maps to `online-store` and `van_sales` maps to `van-sales`.
- Fresh Production SQL at `2026-10-12 21:05:52.666893+00 UTC`: 6 orders total, 3 `pos`, 3 `order-taker`, and currently 0 `online-store`, 0 `telesales`, 0 `van-sales`. No Production test orders were created and no business data was changed.
- Production Edge: `create-runsheet` v26 (`verify_jwt=true)); `append-to-runsheet` v8 (`verify_jwt=true)). Production RPCs `create_runsheet_atomic(uuid,text[],text)` and `append_orders_to_runsheet_atomic(uuid,text,text[],text)` allow normalized `telesales/tele-sales/order-taker/online-store` only; `anon/authenticated EXECUTE=false`, `service_role EXECUTE=true`. Do not broaden this contract for display-label changes.
- Historical store source at commit `b2cd78da3af2ed7ff5f61b5fdea5c3d8a523f907` invokes `submit-online-order`; Production `submit_online_order_atomic` writes source `online_store`, which the current normalization already accepts.
- Recent repository commit checked: `fd94f0357f9525b1f85f36fa981a78afa99a00fe` only adds `_forensic_current_main_extract.md`; it is not the parent source patch. No claim is made that the current source blob is deployed.

## Closure status
`CURRENT GIT SOURCE VERIFIED / PRODUCTION CORE VERIFIED / ONE OWNER SOURCE-LABEL PATCH REQUIRED / SERVED ARTIFACT + BROWSER E2E NOT PROVEN`.

## Next exact resumption point
Owner: apply only the complete `sourceLabel` object replacement in Report418 against current SHA `92bec4b0b006c7a280ba48e0ab4279e44282687a`, then deploy and test source labels and eligibility in the served browser. Do not change `main.html` through the assistant, do not change Production RPC/ACL for this label-only defect, and do not create synthetic production orders.
